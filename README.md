**RFM ANALYSIS**

This is my RFM Analysis done on Vehicle Sales Data using Power BI.

- RFM Analysis stands for Recency, Monetary and Frequency Analysis.

- Recency Score will increase if a customer purchased something quite recently and decreases when the last purchase made by the customer is long back.

- Monetary Score will increase if a customer spends more money and decreases with less spending.

- Frequency Score will increase if a customer purchases regularly and low score if a customer purchases something rarely.

By segmenting our customer base according to their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (R-F-M) behaviors, we gain valuable insights into their engagement levels. 
This allows us to identify our most and least valuable customers. 

For instance, we can pinpoint customers in the 'About to Sleep' cohort, indicating a decline in activity. It's crucial to devise tailored strategies specifically aimed at boosting their purchasing behavior.
